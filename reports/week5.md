### Progress
- Sprite movement is pixel-precise in left/right directions, can be moved up or
  down by cell precision. Can be moved across the screen pixel-by-pixel


### Plans for next week
Continue work on next steps for project:
- Achieve pixel-precision in up/down directions for sprites, as well get rid of
  artifacts in left/right directions that occur.
- Have the ability to keep track and use multiple sprites of same kind.
