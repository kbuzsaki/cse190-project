### Progress
- Sprite movement is pixel-precise in left/right directions, can be moved up or
  down by cell precision. Can be moved across the screen pixel-by-pixel
- Per-pixel vertical sprite movement
- Main loop using interrupt handler instead of infinite loop with busy wait 'sleep'
- Sprite art for different towers in the game


### Plans for next week
Continue work on next steps for project:
- Brainstorm art theme for game
- Fix artifacts in left/right per-pixel sprite movement
- Combine vertical and horizontal sprite movement
- Have the ability to keep track and use multiple sprites of same kind.
