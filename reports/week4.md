### Progress
- Began implementing primitive sprite movement (atm only right movement) based
  on draw methods learned in lecture (i.e. stack POPing and preshifted
  spritemaps).
- Combined previous work on flashing cursor and map loading functionality into a single
  program, 'build_towers'
- Iterated on cursor design and map design
- Added a "build tower" function where the current cell (highlighted by the cursor) is
  set to a tower tile on button press.


### Plans for next week
Continue work on next steps for project:
- Decide possibly a theme for the game (more relevant for sprites than actual
  gameplay)
- Have a more dynamic sprite system set up (freely able to move
  left/right/up/down and being able to keep track of sprites in order to have
  multiple on screen)
- Change keyboard input methods to be interupt based
- add ability to build different towers (maybe also design new tower tiles?)
