### Progress
- Brainstormed game ideas, came up with a bunch: Pacman, Bomberman, Tower Defense, Mario.
  Decided to work on tower defense
- Brainstormed ideas for mechanics and visual effects for tower defense
- Split up initial work for tower defense
- Wrote tile based map loader in assembly and a helper script to generate the `defb` for it.
  Designed an initial demo map
- Created animated stripe program that moves the stripe across the screen
  and wrapped around with the use of refresh interrupts. Figured out how to
  address the bottom portion of the screen.
- Created version of cell-based etchasketch to have a blinking cursor

### Plans for next week
Continue work on next steps for project:
- Combine cursor and tile based map so that cursor can scroll on the map
- Implement "building a tower" with the cursor and another keypress
- Work on animating moving enemy sprites
- Brainstorm and do test work for visual effects
- Design status screen, have something show up on the status screen that live updates
